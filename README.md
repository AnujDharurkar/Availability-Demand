Implemented the Publisher-Subscriber architectural design pattern in this Availability Demand System. For that, I have introduced a Singleton class called ‘Broker’ which will be the intermediary and handle all the events and data in the System. Interfaces are used for their abstract methods and they are implemented in respective classes. As the data was small enough, I didn’t use any complex data storing structures as it would complicate the system and code.
